This is an example post showing you the format. 

When you write a real post, you'll:
1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it with this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
3. Start with the "front matter" (the stuff between the --- lines above)
4. Then write your content in Markdown

## Markdown Basics

**Bold text** with double asterisks
*Italic text* with single asterisks

Lists:
- Just use hyphens
- Like this
- Simple

Quotes:
> Use the > symbol for blockquotes

## That's It

Everything else is just writing. The system handles the rest.
