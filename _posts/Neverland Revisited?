✨ Neverland Re-Visited?

I've been thinking about the original Neverland. Peter and the Lost Boys don't leave because they want freedom in the abstract. They leave because the world they're supposed to grow into already feels finished. Already decided.

So Neverland becomes an escape place. A place where time doesn't harden you. Where you can try things without becoming fixed by them. Where nothing has to stick or scar or become permanent.

As I talk with youth today, I hear the same desire to get away from adult systems. I see the same frustration with being shut out of shaping them. The same sense of being trapped inside structures and decisions they didn't make and can't seem to touch.

The yearning feels familiar. But the direction feels different, in a big way.

They don't seem to be asking, "Where can we go so nothing matters?"
They seem to be asking, "Where can we go so what we do actually counts?"
Not escape. But entry. 
Not disappearance. But authorship. 
Not waiting for permission. But co-shaping what gets built.

Given this, those of us who currently hold power have to ask: What if there's a place young people can go to practice consequence, to experiment, to test, to build something real, so they can return and actually change what once felt locked and immovable?

If the old Neverland was about nothing having to last... maybe the new one is about choosing what will last. About deciding what's worth carrying forward.

What do we call the place where the next generation learns to shape what comes next? LunARC is experimenting with this at the hashtag#LunarUniversity.

I'd love to learn about other spaces where this 'new Neverland' is already starting to form?
