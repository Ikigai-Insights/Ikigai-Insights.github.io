This is a permanent archive for writing on lunar governance, coordination systems, and the infrastructure of humanity's expanded presence.

## LunARC

Much of this writing emerges from work with the Lunar Research Collective (LunARC), a nonprofit building governance infrastructure for lunar settlement through youth-led design labs.

LunARC engages students across 40+ countries in translating diverse epistemologies into coordination frameworks for humanity's multiplanetary future.
